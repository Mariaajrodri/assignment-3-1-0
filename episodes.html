              <h1 >Obesity in America</h1>
              <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Bebas+Neue&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
              <p>These participants were presented with three facts that they haven't heard before and stated their
              honest opinions for the first time in front of the camera. These facts depicted percentages of
              obesity in the United States. It's a topic Americans may be affected by, rather you're the affected
              or you witness the affection; the obesity epidemic began in the U.S in the 1980's, there has been a sharp
              increase since.</p>
              <p>The participants were not asked questions. I did not want to format their answer rather it be in a positive or negative
              perspective. Questions were not created in order to receive pure opinion.</p>

              <h1>Social Media Pressure</h1>
              <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Bebas+Neue&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
              <p>The Social Media Pressure Episode was formatted differently in the sense that facts were not state to the participants.
                 These participants were asked questions that are solely on their personal life resulting to not format their answer rather
                it be in a positive or negative. For example, "What would you be doing without social media?". It's a topic I believe all generations are
                affected by not just Millennials and Generation Z.</p>
